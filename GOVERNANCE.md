# TEOS Egypt — Governance Framework

## Overview
TEOS Egypt is governed through a **progressive decentralization model**, transitioning from a founder-led Genesis Phase to a **DAO- or Foundation-governed civic infrastructure**.

Governance prioritizes **public value, transparency, compliance, and long-term continuity**.

## Governance Phases

### Phase I — Genesis (Current)
- Founder & Chief Architect holds architectural authority
- Decisions documented publicly
- No unilateral treasury extraction
- DAO tooling prepared but not yet activated

### Phase II — Hybrid Governance
- DAO proposals activated
- Role-weighted voting
- Foundation oversight for compliance
- Founder acts as constitutional guardian

### Phase III — Full DAO / Foundation Governance
- On-chain voting for upgrades and treasury
- Independent Foundation stewardship
- Founder role becomes advisory unless re-elected
